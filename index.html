      in Tamil Nadu. His incredible journey from hardships to People's President set an example for everyone to not give up
      at any circumstances and we should not allow the problem to defeat us.</li>

     
     <li>Kalam hailed from a financially poor background, where to support his family income he used to sell newspapers after
      the school hours.
      His father Jainulabdeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque. While his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.</li>

      1954.</li>
     
     <li><strong>1955</strong>- He moved to Madras to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.</li>
     
     <li>After graduation he joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development
      Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence
      Research & Development Service (DRDS).</li>
     
     <li>Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969.</li>
     
     <li><strong>1970-1990</strong>-Kalam played a vital role to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and
      SLV-III projects. After this he showcased his excellence at the time of Pokhran-II nuclear tests.</li>

     <li>After serving a term as the President, he returned to what he always liked 'academics'. Tragically, Dr Kalam took
